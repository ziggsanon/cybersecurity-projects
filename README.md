# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of hands-on cybersecurity projects I‚Äôve completed to demonstrate my skills in threat detection, threat intelligence, incident response, OSINT, cloud security, and automation. Each project focuses on real-world scenarios, aligning with frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK**, **ISO 27001**, and **NIST**.

## üìå Projects Included

### Volt Typhoon OSINT Threat Actor Report
**Focus:** Threat Intelligence, OSINT, MITRE ATT&CK  
Open-source investigation into the Volt Typhoon APT group. Used tools like **Maltego**, **VirusTotal**, **Shodan**, and **HaveIBeenPwned** to profile infrastructure, extract IOCs, and map behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK.

### Digital Forensics Mini-Case (Malware-Based Investigation)
**Focus:** Digital Forensics, IOC Extraction, Malware Behavior  
Simulated malware investigation using sandbox data from **VirusTotal** and **Any.Run**. Extracted IOCs (IPs, domains, registry keys), analyzed behavior, and created a forensics report mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.
